/*

Mirko needs to choose four points in the plane so that they form a rectangle with sides parallel to the axes.
He has already chosen three points and is confident that he hasnâ€™t made a mistake, but is having trouble locating the last point.
Help him.

Input

Each of the three points already chosen will be given on a separate line. All coordinates will be integers between 1 and 1000.

Output

Output the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the rectangle.
