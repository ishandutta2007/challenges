; A bus with n passengers opens its door at the bus stop. Exactly half of its passengers and an additional half of a passenger get out.
; On the next stop, again, half of the passengers plus half of a passenger leave the bus. This goes on for k stops in total.
; Knowing that the bus leaves the last stop empty, and that no one was hurt during the trip, determine the initial number n of people in the bus.
;
; Input
;
; The first line of input contains the number of test cases T. The descriptions of the test cases follow:
;
; The only line of each test case contains the number of stops k, 1≤k≤30.
;
; Output
;
; For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer—the initial number of bus passengers.
