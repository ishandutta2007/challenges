; Yup, yet another trivial problem. You just have to add two integers! Oh, not easy enough? Sure, let’s say that they’re positive as well. Now it should be trivial, right?
;
; Input
;
; The input consists of two lines, each containing a positive integer less than 1010000. Oh right…I forgot to mention that the integers can be quite large.
;
; Output
;
; One line containing the sum of the two integers.
