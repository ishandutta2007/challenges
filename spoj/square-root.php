/*
 
In this problem you have to find the Square Root for given number. You may assume that such a number exist and it will be always an integer.

Input
t - the number of test cases [t <= 50]
then t positive numbers follow, each of them have up to 800 digits in decimal representation.

Output
Output must contain exactly t numbers equal to the square root for given numbers. See sample input/output for details.
