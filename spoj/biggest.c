Do you ever thought about biggest number that you can write ? For a kid,the biggest number that he/she could write is 10 or 100 or 1000 etc and this depends on solely on his/her teacher.

We are not kids and we also have a computer for our help so we can think of much big number,for example consider this one :

93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915 608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000

This is nothing but 100!,but is this the biggest number? I might add 1 to it and thus fail your claim of the biggest number.

This problem is actually a test of your imagination,you supposed to output a number which will be biggest of all numbers that anybody could possibly imagine.

Be careful I may add just 1 and fail your claim! But if you are lucky enough you would possibly output the correct answer.

Input
There is no input to this problem.

Output
The biggest/largest of every number that anybody could possibly imagine.
