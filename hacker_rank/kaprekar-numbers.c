/*
A modified Kaprekar number is a positive whole number with a special property.
If you square it, then split the number into two integers and sum those integers, you have the same value you started with.

Consider a positive whole number n with digits d. We square to arrive at a number that is either 2*d digits long or (2*d)-1 digits long.
Split the string representation of the square into two parts, l and r.
The right hand part r, must be d digits long.
The left is the remaining substring. Convert those two substrings back to integers, add them and see if you get n.

For example, if n = 5, d = 1 then n**2 = 25. We split that into two strings and convert them back to integers 2 and 5.
We test 2 + 5 = 7 != 5, so this is not a modified Kaprekar number. If n = 9, still d = 1, and n**2 = 81.
This gives us 1 + 8 = 9, the original n.

Note: r may have leading zeros.

Here's an explanation from Wikipedia about the ORIGINAL Kaprekar Number (spot the difference!):

	In mathematics, a Kaprekar number for a given base is a non-negative integer, the representation of whose square in that base
	can be split into two parts that add up to the original number again. For instance, 45 is a Kaprekar number, because 45Â² = 2025 and 20+25 = 45.

Given two positive integers p and q where p is lower than q, write a program to print the modified Kaprekar numbers in the range between p and q, inclusive.

Function Description

Complete the kaprekarNumbers function in the editor below. It should print the list of modified Kaprekar numbers in ascending order.

kaprekarNumbers has the following parameter(s):

    p: an integer
    q: an integer

     

Input Format

The first line contains the lower integer limit p.
The second line contains the upper integer limit q.

Note: Your range should be inclusive of the limits.

Output Format

Output each modified Kaprekar number in the given range, space-separated on a single line.
If no modified Kaprekar numbers exist in the given range, print INVALID RANGE.
