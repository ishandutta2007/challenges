itertools.product()

This tool computes the cartesian product of input iterables.
It is equivalent to nested for-loops.
For example, product(A, B) returns the same as ((x,y) for x in A for y in B).

Sample Code

>>> from itertools import product
>>>
>>> print list(product([1,2,3],repeat = 2))
[(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]
>>>
>>> print list(product([1,2,3],[3,4]))
[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4)]
>>>
>>> A = [[1,2,3],[3,4,5]]
>>> print list(product(*A))
[(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)]
>>>
>>> B = [[1,2,3],[3,4,5],[7,8]]
>>> print list(product(*B))
[(1, 3, 7), (1, 3, 8), (1, 4, 7), (1, 4, 8), (1, 5, 7), (1, 5, 8), (2, 3, 7), (2, 3, 8), (2, 4, 7), (2, 4, 8), (2, 5, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 3, 7), (3, 3, 8), (3, 4, 7), (3, 4, 8), (3, 5, 7), (3, 5, 8)]
Task

You are given a two lists A and B. Your task is to compute their cartesian product AxB.
