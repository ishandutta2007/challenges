/*

Bit masking is a technique used to "hide" certain parts of a number.
It's great to use if you want to convey lots of information in a single integer.
It takes a number n, converts it to its binary form, and then returns the digit at the index b of that binary number.
Note that digit 0 is really the last digit since the least significant (smallest) digit is last.
Your job is to create a function bit_mask that takes two arguments - the first being n and the second b - and returns the "masked" form of n.

Examples

bit_mask(37, 2) -> 1
# Binary representation is this:
# 0b100101
#      ^
# We return index 2 from the right, which is 1

bit_mask(56, 1) -> 0
# 0b111000
#        ^

bit_mask(327, 6) -> 1
# 0b101000111
#     ^

Notes

    You cannot use the bin function.
    For an extra challenge, try only using bit operations!
    All numbers 0 â‰¤ n < 256 will be tested.
    There are over 2,000 tests, and they all have to run within 12 seconds (set by Edabit, not me).
    If n is too small to have a bth index, return 0.
