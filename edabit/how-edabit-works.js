/*

This is an introduction to how challenges on Edabit work.
In the Code tab above you'll see a starter function that looks like this:

function hello() {

}

All you have to do is type return "hello edabit.com" between the curly braces { } and then click the Check button.
If you did this correctly, the button will turn red and say SUBMIT FINAL. Click it and see what happens.

Notes

The returned string must be in all lowercase letters.
If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the Resources tab.
If you're really stuck, unlock solutions in the Solutions tab.

function hello() {
	return "hello edabit.com";
}

console.log(hello());
