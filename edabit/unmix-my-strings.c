/*

lPaeesh le pemu mnxit ehess rtnisg! Oh, sorry, that was supposed to say: Please help me unmix these strings!

Somehow my strings have all become mixed up; every pair of characters has been swapped. Help me undo this so I can understand my strings again.

Notes

The length of a string can be odd â€” in this case the last character is not altered (as there's nothing to swap it with).
