/*

Tom is a very methodic guy that loves geometry and pizza: he loves them so much that, before eating a pizza, he calculates its radius and its height. Now, he wants to know from you the total volume of pizza that he swallowed!

You are given the two parameters that Tom measured:

    radius
    height

He tells you that if you multiply the height for the square of the radius and multiply the result for the mathematical constant Ï€ (Pi), you will obtain the total volume of the pizza.
Implement a function that returns the volume of the pizza as a whole number, rounding it to the nearest integer (and rounding up for numbers with .5 as decimal part).
