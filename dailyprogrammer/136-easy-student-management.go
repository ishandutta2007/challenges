/*

You are a computer science professor at South Harmon Institute of Technology, and are in dire need of automatic grading!
The good news is you have all of your student's assignments in an easy-to-read format, making automation easy!

You will be given a list of unique student names, and then a list of their assignment grades.
All assignments are based on 20 points and are scored in whole-numbers (integers).
All students have received the same number of assignments, so you don't have to worry about managing jagged arrays.

Formal Inputs & Outputs
Input Description

On standard console input, you will be given two space-delimited integers N and M: N is the number of students (which ranges from 1 to 60, inclusive), and M is the number of assignments (which ranges from 4 to 100, inclusive).
This will be followed by N lines of text, each starting with an upper-case unique string being is your students name. This is then followed by M integers, which are the grades ranging from 0 to 20, inclusively.

Output Description

On the first line of output, print the class' average grade. Then, for each student, print their name and average grade (up to two decimal points precision).
