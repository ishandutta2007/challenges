For a lot of the questions today we are going to be doing some simple numerical calculus. Don't worry, its not too terrifying.

For the easy problem, write a function that can take in a list of y-values that represents a function sampled on some domain. The domain can be specified as a list of x-values or two values for the x-minimum and x-maximum (the x-coordinates of the endpoints)

This function should output another list of values that represents the derivative of that function over the same domain.

Python example:

print derivative(xmin=-1,xmax=1,y=[-1.0,-.5,0,.5,1.0])
outputs:

[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]
Bonus 1) Write the same function but for the indefinite integral.

Bonus 2) This is sort-of an alternate version of the problem... if your language supports first-order functions (that is, functions as data), then write a function that takes a function A as an argument and returns a function A'.
When A' is evaluated at x, it computes an approximation of the derivative at x

EDIT: devil's assassin gave a decently good explaination of the problem, I'm stealing it here and modifying it a bit.

for those of you who don't know, the derivative can be defined as the slope of the tangent line at a particular point.
I'm assuming he wants a numerical derivative, making this a programming exercise and not a math one. We need to interpolate those values into a derivative.
If you have some set of numbers N = {a1,a2,a3,a4,...,an} and some domain set S={b1,b2,...,bn} you can find the slope between two points on this line.
Now this is a /bad/ approximation, but it can be made better through limiting the step size.

Basically, here is the formula:

f'(x) = lim h->0(f(x+h) - f(x))/h

the "lim" part, means that this only works when h is REALLY small (pretty much 0, but without being exactly 0 so there is no dividing by 0). So you can modify this:

f'(x) ~= f(x+h)-f(x)/h

Basically, what you do here is use compute the slope between the current point and the next point for each point. Use the slope equation from two points.

func derivative(xmin, xmax float64, y []float64) []float64 {
	n := len(y)
	x := []float64{}
	xc := xmin
	for i := 0; i < n-1; i++ {
		x = append(x, xc)
		xc += (xmax - xmin) / float64(n-1)
	}
	x = append(x, xmax)

	r := make([]float64, n)
	for i := 0; i < n-1; i++ {
		r[i] = (y[i+1] - y[i]) / (x[i+1] - x[i])
	}
	r[n-1] = r[n-2]

	return r
}
