/*

Morse code, as we are all aware, consists of dots and dashes. Lets define a "Morse code sequence" as simply a series of dots and dashes (and nothing else). So ".--.-.--" would be a morse code sequence, for instance.

Dashes obviously take longer to transmit, that's what makes them dashes. Lets say that a dot takes 1 unit of time to transmit, and a dash takes 2 units of time.
Then we can say that the "size" of a certain morse code sequence is the sum of the time it takes to transmit the dots and dashes.
So, for instance "..-." would have a size of 5 (since there's three dots taking three units of time and one dash taking two units of time, for a total of 5). The sequence "-.-" would also have a size of 5.

In fact, if you list all the the possible Morse code sequences of size 5, you get:

.....  ...-  ..-.  .-..  -...  .--  -.-  --.

A total of 8 different sequences.

Your task is to write a function called Morse(X) which generates all morse code sequences of size X and returns them as an array of strings (so Morse(5) should return the 8 strings I just mentioned, in some order).

Use your function to generate and print out all sequences of size 10.

Bonus: Try and write your code so that it can generate Morse(35) (or even Morse(36) or higher, but that takes a significant amount of memory) in a "reasonable" amount of time.
"Reasonable" obviously depend on what computer and programming language you are using, but a good rule of thumb should be that it should finish in less than a minute.
