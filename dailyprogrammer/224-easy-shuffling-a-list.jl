Description
We've had our fair share of sorting algorithms, now let's do a shuffling challenge. In this challenge, your challenge is to take a list of inputs and change around the order in random ways. Think about shuffling cards - can your program shuffle cards?

EDIT 07-25-2014 In case this isn't obvious, the intention of this challenge is for you to implement this yourself and not rely on a standard library built in (e.g. Python's "random.shuffle()" or glibc's "strfry()").

Input Description
You'll be given a list of values - integers, letters, words - in one order. The input list will be space separated. Example:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Output Description
Your program should emit the values in any non-sorted order; sequential runs of the program or function should yield different outputs. You should maximize the disorder if you can. From our example:

7 5 4 3 1 8 2 6
Challenge Input
apple blackberry cherry dragonfruit grapefruit kumquat mango nectarine persimmon raspberry raspberry
a e i o u
Challenge Output
Examples only, this is all about shuffling

raspberry blackberry nectarine kumquat grapefruit cherry raspberry apple mango persimmon dragonfruit
e a i o u

Bonus
Check out the Faro shuffle and the Fisher-Yates shuffles, which are algorithms for specific shuffles. Shuffling has some interesting mathematical properties.

=#

using Random

println(shuffle(Vector(1:8)))
println(shuffle(["apple" "blackberry" "cherry" "dragonfruit" "grapefruit" "kumquat" "mango" "nectarine" "persimmon" "raspberry" "raspberry"]))
println(shuffle(['a' 'e' 'i' 'o' 'u']))
