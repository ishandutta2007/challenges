Description

In mathematics, a Ruthâ€“Aaron pair consists of two consecutive integers (e.g. 714 and 715) for which the sums of the distinct prime factors of each integer are equal. For example, we know that (714, 715) is a valid Ruth-Aaron pair because its distinct prime factors are:

714 = 2 * 3 * 7 * 17
715 = 5 * 11 * 13

and the sum of those is both 29:

2 + 3 + 7 + 17 = 5 + 11 + 13 = 29

The name was given by Carl Pomerance, a mathematician at the University of Georgia, for Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron, as Ruth's career regular-season home run total was 714, a record which Aaron eclipsed on April 8, 1974, when he hit his 715th career home run. A student of one of Pomerance's colleagues noticed that the sums of the distinct prime factors of 714 and 715 were equal.

For a little more on it, see MathWorld - http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Ruth-AaronPair.html

Your task today is to determine if a pair of numbers is indeed a valid Ruth-Aaron pair.
Input Description

You'll be given a single integer N on one line to tell you how many pairs to read, and then that many pairs as two-tuples. For example:

3
(714,715)
(77,78)
(20,21)

Output Description

Your program should emit if the numbers are valid Ruth-Aaron pairs. Example:

(714,715) VALID
(77,78) VALID
(20,21) NOT VALID

Chalenge Input

4
(5,6)
(2107,2108)
(492,493)
(128,129)

Challenge Output

(5,6) VALID
(2107,2108) VALID
(492,493) VALID
(128,129) NOT VALID
