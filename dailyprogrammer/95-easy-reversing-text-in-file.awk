# Write a program that reads text from a file, and then outputs the text to another file but with all the lines reversed and all the words in each line reversed.
#
# So, for instance, if you had one file called the "thetyger.txt" which contained the two first verses of William Blake's The Tyger:
#
# Tyger! Tyger! burning bright 
# In the forests of the night, 
# What immortal hand or eye 
# Could frame thy fearful symmetry? 
#
# In what distant deeps or skies 
# Burnt the fire of thine eyes? 
# On what wings dare he aspire? 
# What the hand dare sieze the fire? 
#
# Your program would output this to "thetyger2.txt" (or whatever you want to call the file):
#
# fire? the sieze dare hand the What
# aspire? he dare wings what On
# eyes? thine of fire the Burnt
# skies or deeps distant what In
#
# symmetry? fearful thy frame Could
# eye or hand immortal What
# night, the of forests the In
# bright burning Tyger! Tyger!
