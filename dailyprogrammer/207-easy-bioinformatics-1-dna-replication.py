For this week my theme is bioinformatics, I hope you enjoy the taste of the field through these challenges.

Description
DNA - deoxyribonucleic acid - is the building block of every organism. It contains information about hair color, skin tone, allergies, and more.
It's usually visualized as a long double helix of base pairs. DNA is composed of four bases - adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine - paired as follows: A-T and G-C.

Meaning: on one side of the strand there may be a series of bases

A T A A G C
And on the other strand there will have to be

T A T T C G
It is your job to generate one side of the DNA strand and output the two DNA strands. Your program should take a DNA sequence as input and return the complementary strand.

Input
A A T G C C T A T G G C

Output
A A T G C C T A T G G C
T T A C G G A T A C C G

Extra Challenge
Three base pairs make a codon. These all have different names based on what combination of the base pairs you have. A handy table can be found here. The string of codons starts with an ATG (Met) codon ends when a STOP codon is hit.

For this part of the challenge, you should implement functionality for translating the DNA to a protein sequence based on the codons, recalling that every generated DNA strand starts with a Met codon and ends with a STOP codon.
Your program should take a DNA sequence and emit the translated protein sequence, complete with a STOP at the terminus.

Input
A T G T T T C G A G G C T A A
Output
A T G T T T C G A G G C T A A
Met Phe Arg Gly STOP
