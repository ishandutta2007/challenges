/*

Description
You're a well known web-dev with far too much confidence, you mistakingly agreed to complete too many projects in too little a timeframe. In order to fix this, you devise a program that will automatically write all of the HTML for you!

But first, you'll need to program it.

Formal Inputs & Outputs
Input description
On standard console input you should be prompted to enter a paragraph.

Output description
Once your paragraph has been entered, it should be saved as a valid HTML file and opened in your default brower to display the results

Sample Inputs & Outputs
Input
"Enter your paragraph:"
"This is my paragraph entry"
Output
(this is the expected content of the .html file)

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p>This is my paragraph entry</p>
    </body>
</html>
Bonus
Implement a good looking default CSS style-sheet that also gets automatically generated.
