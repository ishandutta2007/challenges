; Write a function that given two sorted lists, returns a list whith the two lists merged together into one sorted list.
;
; So, for instance, for inputs [1,5,7,8] and [2,3,4,7,9] it should return [1,2,3,4,5,7,7,8,9].
;
; Try and make your code as efficient as possible.

(defun merge-list (a b)
  (sort (append a b) '<))

(princ (merge-list '(1 5 7 8) '(2 3 4 7 9)))
