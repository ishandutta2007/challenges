Prove formula for series and parallel resistors

***Series
KCL states that sum of current in = sum of currents out
implying that in a series circuit, the current is the same everywhere, this
implies we will have the following equation when we try to sum circuits in
series

R = V/I
Vtotal = V1 + V2 + V3 ...
Itotal = I
Rtotal = Vtotal/I

V1/I + V2/I + V3/I ... = Rtotal/I
R1 + R2 + R3 ... = Rtotal

***Parallel
KVL states that the voltage around a loop is 0, implying that all

I = V/R
Itotal = I1 + I2 + I3 ...
Vtotal = V
Rtotal = V/Itotal

Rtotal = V/(I1 + I2 + I3 ...) substitute current Ix in terms of resistance Rx
Rtotal = V / (V/R1 + V/R2 + V/R3 ...) Divide by V since it is a constant and get
Rtotal = 1 / (1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 ...)
1/Rtotal = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ...
