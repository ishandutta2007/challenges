/*

In olden days finding square roots seemed to be difficult but nowadays it can be easily done using in-built functions available across many languages .

Assume that you happen to hear the above words and you want to give a try in finding the square root of any given integer using in-built functions. So here's your chance.

{
	printf("%.0lf\n", sqrt(10));
	printf("%.0lf\n", sqrt(5));
	printf("%.0lf\n", sqrt(10000));
	return 0;
