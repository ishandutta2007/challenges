/*

You will be given two integers M and N. Find the number of pairs (x,y) such that 1â‰¤xâ‰¤M, 1â‰¤yâ‰¤N and (x+y)mod5=0.

For example, if M=6 and N=12, pairs which satisfies such conditions are, (1,4),(4,1),(1,9),(2,3),(2,8),(3,2),(3,7),(3,12),(4,6),(6,4),(4,11),(5,5),(5,10),(6,9)

Total 14.

Sample

Input : 6 12
Output: 14

Input : 11 14
Output: 31

Input : 553 29
Output: 3208

Input : 2 2
Output: 0

Input : 752486 871672
Output: 131184195318 

This is a code-golf challenge so code with lowest bytes wins!

Update

Jonathan Allan's solution has the smallest code size, 5 bytes. However, it doesn't produce an answer for the last given test.

I have decided to go with the next answer with the shortest size that produces the correct answer for the largest test, there is a tie between two golfers who competed neck-to-neck.

I proudly present the winners of this challenge Lyxal and Kevin Cruijssen with only 7 bytes code! Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

As many of you, I found Arnauld's answer most helpful in finding the correct solution. So, I am accepting Arnauld's answer.

Thank you, Golfers!
