cat << EOF > /dev/null
your challenge is to draw this ASCII art:

|     |  |- - - -  |       |       - - -
|     |  |         |       |       |   |
|- - -|  |- - -    |       |       |   |
|     |  |         |       |       |   |
|     |  |- - - -  |- - -  |- - -  - - -

remember this is code golf meaning you have to answer in the least amount of bytes possible. EDIT: spacing between letters is two spaces. the only symbols used are | and -. NO underscores. i added spaces between the dashes to make it easier to see how many there are
EOF

cat << EOF
|     |  |- - - -  |       |       - - -
|     |  |         |       |       |   |
|- - -|  |- - -    |       |       |   |
|     |  |         |       |       |   |
|     |  |- - - -  |- - -  |- - -  - - -
EOF
