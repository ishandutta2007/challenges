/*

You met a 4-th dimensional being who challenged you to a game of dice. The rules are simple: each player rolls 3 6-sided dice and takes the sum of each combination of 2 dice. The player with the highest sum wins. If the first-highest sum is a tie, consider the second-highest sum, and so on.

Your opponent's dice look normal, but you think they might have more than 6 sides! Your goal is to find out if the alien rolled a number higher than 6.

Your input is a set of 3 integers, separated by at least one character (space or otherwise). Input must not be hard coded.

// All valid inputs
6 7 9
6, 7, 9
(6, 7, 9)
Your output is a string representing if the alien cheated. Any output is allowed, as long as two distinct values exist for cheating/valid. Appended whitespace is permitted.

"ðŸ˜€" // (U+1F600) Valid set of dice
"ðŸ˜ " // (U+1F620) Invalid set of dice
Examples:

<-: 8 11 9
->: ðŸ˜€       // Dice can be found to be 3, 5, and 6, which are all on 6-side die
<-: 9 11 6
->: ðŸ˜        // Dice can be found to be 2, 7, and 4, which means the alien cheated!
Assumptions:

Input will be 3 integers, 2-12
Input numbers can be in any order
Die values will be positive integers
Alien only cheated if they rolled greater than 6
Write a program or function that takes inputs, returns or prints outputs.

Fewest bytes wins!
