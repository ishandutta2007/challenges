I once hacked upstart on my Ubuntu box so that a colored, themeable ASCII Tux displayed on the screen with the boot messages scrolling beneath him. I'm curious to see what kind of ASCII art Linux Penguins you can come up with.

    It must fit in a 80 x 25 terminal, without using the bottom line (thus 80 x 24)
    Compact source code
    Bonus: use color
    Bonus: use variations on the standard Tux

Edit: As a clarification, by "compact source code" I meant smallest source code per number of lines of output. The answers so far have been good but it would be fun to get a diversity of penguins going.
