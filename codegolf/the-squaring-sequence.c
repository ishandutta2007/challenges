/*

Each term in the squaring sequence, xn, is created by taking xnâˆ’1, squaring it, and removing all but the first four digits.

The sequence always begins with x1=1111. Squaring this yields 1234321, so x2=1234

The first few terms are:

1111
1234
1522
2316
5363
...
The Challenge
Your task is to, given a non-negative integer n, calculate xn. You may submit a full program which performs I/O, or a function which takes n as a parameter.

Your solution can be zero or one indexed, as long as you specify which.

Because all the terms in this sequence are shorter than 5 digits, your code should be as short as possible too. Standard code-golf loopholes apply.

May the best golfer win!

Test Cases
Note: These are 1-indexed.

1   -> 1111
8   -> 6840
15  -> 7584
20  -> 1425
80  -> 4717
