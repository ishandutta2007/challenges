/*

Write some code...

Write a program that takes no input and outputs an integer n which is a multiple of 3. So n=3k, where k is a positive integer.
Double the last character of your code.
Your code should then output k.
Examples

Here is my program hui#2(21+4)//lm, which outputs 81. Because of that, hui#2(21+4)//lmm should output 27.
or
If p8$w2*8 outputs 9, p8$w2*88 should output 3.
Rules

This is code-golf, shortest answer in bytes wins!
