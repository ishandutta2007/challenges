/*

The task is simple: print The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog using as few distinct characters in your source code as possible.

print "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" has a score of 29 characters, as all 26 lowercase letters appear at least once, as well as an uppercase T, spaces, and quote characters. I'm sure you can get more creative than that, though!

In the event of a tie, the shorter answer will be accepted.

Validity criterion: your language's syntax must be composed of more than 8 semantically meaningful characters. (For example, Whitespace would be disallowed for only having 3 such characters.)

fn main() {
    println!("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog");
}
