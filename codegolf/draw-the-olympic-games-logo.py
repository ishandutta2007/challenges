Your art doesn't have to look exactly like mine, but it has to represent the Olympic rings well enough that it's recognizable.

Rules
The program must write the art to the console.
Shortest code (in bytes, any language) wins.
A solution that prints rings in their respective colors (or a close representation) will be awarded a minus-twenty-point bonus.
The winner will be chosen on February 23rd at the end of the 2014 Winter Olympics.
