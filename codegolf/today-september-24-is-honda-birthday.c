/*

today (24 of September) is birthday of company HONDA. Originally their company name is

本田技研工業株式会社

I want to ask to make a gift for HONDA. The task is to make program print company name. You can do it any way you want, but there is only one rule, Unicode is not allowed. It should be ASCII art.

I want to ask to post code and output. As always to determine winner I'll look at the length of code, however portrait in this case is also important.

EDIT: output have to look similar into this: 本田技研工業株式会社

#include <stdio.h>

int
main(void)
{
	printf("%s\n", u8"本田技研工業株式会社");
	return 0;
}
