/*

Today, Numberphile posted this video where it's stated that 1+2+3+4+...+n = -1/12.

While this isn't really new (several ways to prove that have been found, you can look here for further informations), this leads us to our question!

Your goal is to write a function that returns -0.083333 (feel free to stop at -0.083 if you wish), which is -1/12.

Be original, since this is a popularity-contest!

#include <stdio.h>

int
main(void)
{
	printf("%f\n", -1.0 / 12);
	return 0;
}
