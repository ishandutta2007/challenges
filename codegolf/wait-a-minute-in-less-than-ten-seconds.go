Task

Using any type of parallelisation, wait multiple periods, for a total sleep time of at least a minute (but less than a minute and a half).

The program/function must terminate within 10 seconds and return (by any means and in any format) two values: the total elapsed time, and the total executed sleep time. Both time values have to have a precision of at least 0.1 seconds.

This is similar to the concept of man-hours: a job that takes 60 hours can be completed in only 6 hours if 10 workers are splitting the job. Here we can have 60 seconds of sleep time e.g. in 10 parallel threads, thus requiring only 6 seconds for the whole job to be completed.
Example

The program MyProgram creates 14 threads, each thread sleeps for 5 seconds:

MyProgram â†’ [5.016,70.105]

The execution time is greater than 5 seconds, and the total sleep time is greater than 70 seconds because of overhead.
