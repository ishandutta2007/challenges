#!/usr/bin/env ruby

=begin

Input must not be required, and output must read "All your base are belong to us".

Restrictions

    No external resources.

    Plus a minimum of two of the following:

    You cannot use "a", "b", "t", "u", or "y" in any case in your code (bonus -10 to your golf score if you can do this)

    You cannot use "l", "o", "s", "e", or "r" in any case in your code (bonus -20 to your golf score if you can do this)

    You cannot use "n", "g", "0", "1", or "2" in any case in your code (bonus -30 to your golf score if you can do this)

So for example, if you manage to get the code done with 40 characters and use rules 1 and 2, your golf score is 40 - 10 - 20 = 10 chars.

Smallest code golf score wins... Good luck!

=end

puts "All your base are belong to us";
