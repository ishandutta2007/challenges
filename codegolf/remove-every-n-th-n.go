/*

The task

In this challenge, your input is a non-empty list of positive integers, given in the native format of your language.
Your output is that same list, in the same format, with some elements removed.
You shall remove every occurrence of 1, every second occurrence of 2, every third occurrence 3, and so on.
In general, for every positive integer N, you shall remove every Nth occurrence of N from the list, starting with the Nth occurrence.

Example

Consider the input list

[3,2,6,1,1,6,2,3,2,6,6,6,6,1,6,6,3,3,7,2]
First, we remove every occurrence of 1:

[3,2,6,    6,2,3,2,6,6,6,6,  6,6,3,3,7,2]
Then every second occurrence of 2:

[3,2,6,    6,  3,2,6,6,6,6,  6,6,3,3,7  ]
Then every third occurrence of 3:

[3,2,6,    6,  3,2,6,6,6,6,  6,6,  3,7  ]
The numbers 4 and 5 don't occur in the input, so they can be skipped. Next, we remove every sixth occurrence of 6:

[3,2,6,    6,  3,2,6,6,6,    6,6,  3,7  ]
There's only one occurrence of 7, so that can be skipped as well. Thus the correct output is

[3,2,6,6,3,2,6,6,6,6,6,3,7]
Rules and scoring
You can write either a full program or a function. The lowest byte count wins, and standard loopholes are disallowed.
