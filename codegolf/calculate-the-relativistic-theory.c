In special relativity, the velocity of a moving object relative to another object that is moving in the opposite direction is given by the formula:

s=v+u1+vu/c2.

s = ( v + u ) / ( 1 + v * u / c ^ 2)

In this formula, v
and u are the magnitudes of the velocities of the objects, and c is the speed of light (which is approximately 3.0Ã—108m/s

, a close enough approximation for this challenge).

For example, if one object was moving at v = 50,000 m/s, and another object was moving at u = 60,000 m/s, the velocity of each object relative to the other would be approximately s = 110,000 m/s. This is what you would expect under Galilean relativity (where velocities simply add). However, if v = 50,000,000 m/s and u = 60,000,000 m/s, the relative velocity would be approximately 106,451,613 m/s, which is significantly different than the 110,000,000 m/s predicted by Galilean relativity.
The Challenge

Given two integers v and u such that 0 <= v,u < c, calculate the relativistic additive velocity, using the above formula, with c = 300000000. Output must be either a decimal value or a reduced fraction. The output must be within 0.001 of the actual value for a decimal value, or exact for a fraction.
