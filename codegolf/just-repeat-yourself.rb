Write a program that outputs

Do not repeat yourself!
Your program code must respect the following constraints:

its length must be an even number each character that is in position 2n (where n is an integer > 0) must be equal to the character in position 2n-1.
The second character of the program is equal to the first, the fourth is equal to the third, etc.
Newlines count as characters!

This is code-golf, so the shortest code wins!

Examples
HHeellllooWWoorrlldd is a valid program

123 or AAABBB or HHeello are incorrect

Verification
You can use this CJam script to verify that your source code is valid. Simply paste your code into the "Input" box and run the script.

=end

puts "Do not repeat yourself!"
