...will you help me immortalize it?

enter image description here

I've had this pillow a few years now, and apparently it's time to get rid of it. Can you please write a function or program, that I can bring with me and use to recreate this pillow whenever I want to reminisce a bit.

It must work with no input arguments.

The output should look exactly like this (trailing newlines and spaces are OK).

This is code golf, so the shortest code in bytes win!
