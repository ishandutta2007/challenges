/*

I don't know who coined these words, and I'm not Irish, but I give you an Irish blessing:

May the road rise up to meet you
May the wind be always at your back
May the sun shine warm upon your face
The rains fall soft upon your fields
And until we meet again
May God hold you in the hollow of His hand

I was planning on posting this a few weeks from now, but it just dawned on me that yesterday was Saint Patrick's Day.

Rules:

    Produce the above text exactly.
    (Feel free to break this rule for the sake of cleverness and amusement.)
    The program must generate the text on its own accord. cat is not a valid solution.
    The solution with the fewest characters "wins".

I saw slight variations in wording among versions of the blessing I obtained from the Internet, so I tried to average them out.
Please use the version posted above. Also, I dropped the punctuation to make it a bit easier.

May the luck of the Irish enfold you.

    println!("May the road rise up to meet you");
    println!("May the wind be always at your back");
    println!("May the sun shine warm upon your face");
    println!("The rains fall soft upon your fields");
    println!("And until we meet again");
    println!("May God hold you in the hollow of His hand");
