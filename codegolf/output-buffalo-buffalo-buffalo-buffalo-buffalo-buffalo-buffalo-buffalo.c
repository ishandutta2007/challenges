Challenge

The goal is to output Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.

Context. (Maybe another interesting challenge could be printing all of the other examples?
This would probably use similar logic but involve either a function or just a for loop.)

Rule(s)

    You cannot output anything other than the string with correct casing and spacing. Trailing new lines are allowed, trailing spaces are not.

This is code-golf, so fewest bytes win!

#include <stdio.h>

int
main(void)
{
	printf("Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo\n");
	return 0;
}
