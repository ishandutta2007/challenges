/*

Ash has a bit of an interesting float division algorithm. It's designed to never return NaN, and things like signed zero and infinity need to be handled.

How it works:

Assume the inputs are positive for the rules below. One input being negative will always result in the output being negative, and both being negative will result in a positive output.

    Zero divided by anything is 0
    Anything other than 0 divided by 0 is Infinity
    Anything other than Infinity divided by Infinity is 0
    Infinity divided by anything other than Infinity is Infinity
    Infinity divided by Infinity is 1
    All other division works as normal

I/O:

For languages with floats that support signed zero and positive/negative infinity, floats are an accepted I/O format.
For others, using a string is allowed. You can use any reasonable format in this string, and you can represent the infinities with anything that can't be confused with another number (such as I, âˆž, inf, or :().

Input will always be two floats in your chosen representation, and output will be a single one. Floating point errors and large numbers being represented as Infinity are allowed.

Test cases:

0 / 0                   0
0 / 1                   0
0 / 8                   0
0 / Infinity            0
