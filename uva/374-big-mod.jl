Calculate
R := B^P mod M
for large values of B, P, and M using an efficient algorithm. (Thatâ€™s right, this problem has a time dependency !!!.)

Input

The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below.
Consecutive test cases are separated by a single blank line.
Three integer values (in the order B, P, M) will be read one number per line. B and P are integers in the range 0 to 2147483647 inclusive.
M is an integer in the range 1 to 46340 inclusive.

Output

For each test, the result of the computation. A single integer on a line by itself.
