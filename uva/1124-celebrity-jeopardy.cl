; It’s hard to construct a problem that’s so easy that everyone will get it, yet still difficult enough to be worthy of some respect.
; Usually, we err on one side or the other. How simple can a problem really be?
; Here, as in Celebrity Jepoardy, questions and answers are a bit confused, and, because the participants are celebrities, there’s a real need to make the challenges simple.
; Your program needs to prepare a question to be solved — an equation to be solved — given the answer.
; Specifically, you have to write a program which finds the simplest possible equation to be solved given the answer, considering
; all possible equations using the standard mathematical symbols in the usual manner.
; In this context, simplest can be defined unambiguously several different ways leading to the same path of resolution.
; For now, find the equation whose transformation into the desired answer requires the least effort.
; For example, given the answer X = 2, you might create the equation 9 − X = 7.
; Alternately, you could build the system X > 0; X2 = 4.
; These may not be the simplest possible equations.
; Solving these mind-scratchers might be hard for a celebrity.
;
; Input
; Each input line contains a solution in the form < symbol > = < value >
;
; Output
; For each input line, print the simplest system of equations which would to lead to the provided solution,
; respecting the use of space exactly as in the input.
;
; Sample Input
; Y = 3
; X=9
;
; Sample Output
; Y = 3
; X=9

(defun solve (x) x)

(print (solve "Y = 3"))
(print (solve "X=9"))
